# About Me
My name is Jakub Kubala. I am master of Far East Studies, speciality - Mandarin Chinese. I graduated from Jagiellonian University and Tischner European School in Krakow. In the last year I became interested in software testing. My goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills. I am fascinated by the automated tests and would like to develop in that direction.
